GroupB_Practical5 :  C++ Program To read details of a book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections. Construct a tree and print the    nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.

GroupB_Practical7 : Construct an expression tree from the given prefix and traverse it using post order traversal and then delete the entire tree.

GroupC_Practical13 : Represent a given grapg using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as a graph. Identify the prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.
a) Adjacency Matrix 
b) Adjecency List

GroupC_Practical14 : There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between City A and City B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be represented by the airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
